    <h2>Explanation:</h2>
    <p>
        The Knight's Tour problem is a classical backtracking problem. The goal is to move a knight on a chessboard of
        size
        ùëÅ
        √ó
        ùëÅ
        N√óN such that the knight visits every square exactly once. The knight moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one
        direction (horizontal or vertical) and one square in the other direction.

        To solve this problem, we can use backtracking. We try to make a move to an unvisited square and recursively
        attempt to visit all the remaining squares. If we reach a point where no further valid moves are possible, we
        backtrack and undo the previous move.

        Steps to Solve the Knight's Tour Problem
        Representation:

        The board is represented as an
        ùëÅ
        √ó
        ùëÅ
        N√óN grid where each square is either visited or not.
        Valid Moves:

        The knight can move to 8 possible positions from any square, so the moves can be represented as a list of pairs:
        css
        Copy code
        moves = [(2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1), (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)]
        These moves correspond to the knight's ability to move in an "L" shape.
        Backtracking:

        Start from the given position and try moving the knight to all possible valid positions.
        If the knight can visit all squares, record the number of jumps (moves) it took.
        If the knight gets stuck, backtrack and try a different path.
        Base Case:

        If all squares are visited, print the number of moves and return true.
        Recursive Case:

        For each move, recursively try to visit the next square. If a valid path exists, return true.
        If no valid moves remain, backtrack to the previous position.

        Explanation of the Code
        Constants:

        N defines the size of the chessboard (8x8 for a standard chessboard).
        moveX and moveY arrays define the 8 possible knight moves (relative to the current position).
        isValid():

        Checks if the knight's move is within the bounds of the chessboard and if the destination square has not been
        visited yet.
        printBoard():

        Prints the current board, where each cell contains the move number at which the knight visited that cell.
        solveKT():

        This is the core recursive function. It starts at the given position (x, y) and tries all possible moves in
        sequence. If a valid move is found, it makes the move and recursively tries to solve the rest of the board.
        If all squares are visited (base case), the function returns true. If no valid move is found, it backtracks by
        resetting the cell to -1 and trying the next possible move.
        knightTour():

        This function initializes the board and begins the knight's tour starting from a given position (startX,
        startY).
        Main:

        The knightTour(0, 0) function call starts the knight's tour from the top-left corner of the chessboard (position
        (0, 0)).
