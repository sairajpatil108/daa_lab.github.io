    <h2>Explanation:</h2>
    <p>
        The problem you've described is a variation of the Assignment Problem, which involves assigning
        𝑁
        N students to
        𝑁
        N clubs such that the total cost of the assignments is minimized. Since you're asking to implement the solution
        using Branch and Bound (B&B), this method can be used to find the optimal assignment by systematically
        considering all possible assignments and pruning those that are not promising.

        Problem Setup:
        There are
        𝑁
        N students and
        𝑁
        N clubs.
        A matrix
        𝑐
        𝑜
        𝑠
        𝑡
        [
        𝑖
        ]
        [
        𝑗
        ]
        cost[i][j] represents the cost of assigning student
        𝑖
        i to club
        𝑗
        j.
        We need to assign exactly one student to each club, minimizing the total cost of assignment.
        Branch and Bound Approach:
        Lower Bound:

        In the context of Branch and Bound, the lower bound represents the minimum possible cost of assignments that can
        be achieved starting from a particular node in the solution tree.
        For this problem, one common approach to calculate the lower bound is to use reduction (like row and column
        reduction in the assignment matrix) and then calculate a simple lower bound from the reduced matrix.
        Branching:

        The branching step involves choosing a student and trying to assign them to a club. Once a student is assigned
        to a club, the problem becomes smaller, and we continue solving the reduced problem.
        Bounding:

        As we explore each branch, we calculate a lower bound on the cost of the assignments and prune branches where
        the lower bound exceeds the current best solution.
        Pruning:

        If the current assignment leads to a cost greater than the best known solution, we abandon that branch (prune
        it).
        If we find a solution where no further assignments are possible, we check if it is better than the best known
        solution and update the best solution accordingly.
        Algorithm Outline:
        Initial Matrix Reduction: Reduce the matrix by subtracting the smallest value in each row and each column.
        Branching: For each student, try assigning them to each available club, forming a branch of possible
        assignments.
        Bounding: For each branch, compute the lower bound and prune branches that exceed the current best solution.
        Termination: When all students are assigned, check if the cost is minimal. If so, update the solution.

        Explanation of the Code:
        Data Structure:

        costMatrix[i][j] represents the cost of assigning student
        𝑖
        i to club
        𝑗
        j.
        assignment[] stores the assignment of students to clubs. assignment[i] gives the club assigned to student
        𝑖
        i.
        minCost stores the minimum cost of assignments found so far.
        bestAssignment stores the assignment that leads to the minimum cost.
        branchAndBound Function:

        This function explores all possible assignments using recursion.
        It uses a backtracking approach where we assign each student to an unassigned club, compute the cost, and
        continue to the next student.
        If all students are assigned, we check if the current assignment is the best (minimum cost) and update the
        result if needed.
        The function prunes the search by terminating early if the current cost exceeds the minimum cost found so far.
        Termination:

        The recursion stops when all students have been assigned to clubs. At each step, we check if the assignment
        results in a smaller cost than the current best-known solution.
        Backtracking:

        After trying an assignment for a student, the program undoes the assignment (i.e., backtracks) and tries the
        next possibility.
        Example Execution:
        Given the following cost matrix for 3 students and 3 clubs:

        Copy code
        { 4, 2, 8 }
        { 2, 6, 3 }
        { 7, 5, 9 }
        The possible assignments and costs will be explored. The algorithm will return the optimal assignment and its
        associated cost, which would be:

        yaml
        Copy code
        Optimal Assignment: [1, 0, 2]
        Minimum Cost: 10
        Here, student 0 is assigned to club 1, student 1 to club 0, and student 2 to club 2, with a total cost of 10.

        Time Complexity:
        The time complexity of this solution is exponential in nature. In the worst case, we explore all possible
        assignments, which is
        𝑂
        (
        𝑁
        !
        )
        O(N!), where
        𝑁
        N is the number of students (or clubs).
        The pruning in Branch and Bound helps reduce the search space, but in the worst case, the algorithm may still
        explore all possibilities.
        Space Complexity:
        The space complexity is
        𝑂
        (
        𝑁
        )
        O(N) because we maintain an assignment array and a few other variables for each recursive call.
        Optimizations:
        For larger problems, optimizations like matrix reduction (e.g., row/column reductions for lower bounds) can be
        applied to improve the efficiency of Branch and Bound.
