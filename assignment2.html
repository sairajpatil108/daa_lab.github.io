    <h2>Explanation:</h2>
    <p>Sorting by Profit:

        Jobs are sorted in descending order of their profits so that high-profit tasks are considered first.
        Time Slot Array:

        timeSlot[] keeps track of which time slots are occupied, ensuring that no two jobs are scheduled at the same
        time.
        The size of this array is determined by the maximum deadline among the tasks.
        Iterating Over Jobs:

        For each job, find the latest available time slot before its deadline.
        If a slot is available, assign the job to that slot, and add its profit to the total profit.
        Output:

        The jobSequence[] array stores the order of jobs scheduled.
        The total profit is also displayed.
        Example Input and Output
        Input
        Jobs with IDs, profits, and deadlines:

        Job1: Profit = 100, Deadline = 2
        Job2: Profit = 19, Deadline = 1
        Job3: Profit = 27, Deadline = 2
        Job4: Profit = 25, Deadline = 1
        Job5: Profit = 15, Deadline = 3
        Output

        Copy code

        Job Sequence: Job1 Job3 Job5
